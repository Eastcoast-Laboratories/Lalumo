Description: |-
  Lalumo - Children Discover Music with Heart and Ear

  With Lalumo, young children dive into the colorful world of music! In a playful way and with
  lovingly designed animal characters, they explore pitch, melody, timbre, and rhythm - no prior
  knowledge needed. Musical concepts are experienced intuitively.

  Features:
  * Children recognize pitches by listening and pressing the right animal
  * Child-friendly activities
  * Listen to familiar children's songs and decide if they sound right or "wrong"
  * Choose animals that match pleasant or strange-sounding melodies
  * Explore rising, falling or jumping melodies
  * No ads, no in-app purchases
  * Child lock mode and screen protection
  * Palm rejection for multitouch
  * Beautiful illustrations resembling hand-painted picture books
  * Fully usable offline, distraction-free

  Perfect for preschoolers, parents who want to support early musical learning, and educators
  who want to introduce children to worlds of sound.
