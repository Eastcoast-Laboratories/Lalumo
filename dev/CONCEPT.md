# Concept for a Child-Friendly Music Understanding App

## Working Title: "Musici"

## Goal of the App

The app playfully teaches preschool children a basic understanding of music – without classical music theory, without real instruments, without pressure. Instead, the focus is on listening, feeling, and experiencing: pitch, chords, rhythm, timbres, and musicality.

## 1. Classification and Unique Selling Point

- No focus on classical music, notes, or specific instruments
- No complicated rules – the child listens, feels, plays, and learns subconsciously
- Age-appropriate guidance: ideal for children between 3 and 6 years
- Supports early musical education and emotional development
## 2. Chapter Structure of the App (Learning Areas)

### Discovering Timbres

Children hear different sounds (e.g., warm, cold, sharp, soft) and learn to distinguish them. They playfully select, for example, "the softest tone."

### Pitches and Melodies

Tones going up, down, waves, jumps: Children recognize tone movements and assign them to images (e.g., a rocket for ascending tones).

### Experiencing Rhythm

Children tap, jump, or tap along. The app recognizes how well the rhythm was matched – and provides motivating feedback.

### Feeling Chords

Simple triads are translated into colors, moods, or figures. Children can guess, draw, or match them.

### Free Sound Play

A space for free discovery: Children can paint tones, let figures dance to pitches, or tell stories with sounds.

## 3. User Guidance for Young Children

- Large, intuitive buttons
- No reading skills required: everything is spoken and explained through pictures
- Recurring characters guide through the chapters
- Progress is visualized in the form of a "growing sound garden"
## 4. Technical Implementation with Capacitor and Windsurf

- Capacitor as a bridge to Android and iOS
- Frontend: with Alpine.js or React (depending on interaction needs)
- Backend: Audio engine locally with Web Audio API, no server dependency
- Windsurf AI Support:
  - Voice guidance is supplemented by text-to-speech (local)
  - Windsurf helps with the creation of child-friendly exercise scenarios, tone combinations, and sound design
  - Test cases are generated with AI (e.g., "What to do if the child always selects the highest tone?")

## 5. Graphical Implementation

### Style

- Soft, round, warm – no bright colors, no overstimulation
- Recurring, friendly creatures: e.g., a singing ball, a dancing cloud
- Interactive elements should be animated and rewarding – but never distracting
- Each chapter gets its own visual space (e.g., "the rhythm rainforest," "the air castle of heights")

## 6. Development Structure

### Overview

- One HTML entry point, but a modular code structure
- Central index.html, where different sections ("partials") are shown or hidden depending on the chapter, controlled via Alpine components or x-show

### Chapter Structure

- Structure chapters as Alpine components: Each area like "Rhythm" or "Pitches" is described by its own `<div x-data>` with associated methods, states, and possibly templates

### Code Organization

- External JS file (app.js) with methods needed across components (e.g., playing pitches, saving progress)
- Partials via x-if or x-show, not via includes – Alpine.js doesn't have template includes like Vue, but you can work well with x-transition and x-show to show or hide entire chapters

### Layout Concept

- A layout concept with a central `<main x-data="app()">` that handles control (navigation, progress, etc.)
