# Musici Progress Bar Extraction Plan

## Notes
- User wants to extract the progress bar (Fortschrittsbalken) from section 1_3 in `pitches.js` (currently inline around lines 2374–2456) and reuse it in 1_4.
- Reusable progress bar function `showActivityProgressBar` created in `src/effects/feedback.js`.
- Progress bar utility imported into `pitches.js` for use in activities.
- Inline code cleanup completed via sed; duplicate block removed and lint/syntax errors resolved.
- Level progression should now increase after **3** correct answers (was 10); progress bar totals must reflect this.
- Progress bar invoked in **1_4 Sound Judgment** via reusable function.
- Closing brace/comma issue in 1_4 progress bar block patched via sed.
- Semicolon build error fixed again; quote escaping issue in `containerSelector` resolved; Node syntax check passes.
- 1_4 duplicate progress bar removed; existing display now uses denominator **3** via reusable function.
- User reports 1_4 progress bar is missing/not visible; adjust placement or CSS to ensure it appears in viewport.
- Progress bar function now called within `updateSoundJudgmentLevelDisplay()` to render bar; visibility needs verification.
- Progress bar now appears but is attached to bottom of viewport; needs to be inserted within activity container. Two text rows shown (top and bottom); bottom bar must be relocated or removed so only one unified display inside activity.
- Position override passed to `showActivityProgressBar` in `updateSoundJudgmentLevelDisplay()` to render bar relative to the activity container; verify that only one bar is visible.
- Bottom stray bar removed; progress bar now rendered relative inside the activity container via positioning override; need final visual verification.
- Occasional wrong melody shown at start of 1_4 and note duration mismatches reported; investigate melody generation and timing logic.
- Diagnostic logging added: `MELODY_NAME_DEBUG` in `generateSoundHighOrLowMelody()` to trace melody selection; further duration logging planned.
- UI melody name is now cleared before generation and updated post-generation to prevent stale titles.
- New requirement refined: Menu **must stay open for chapters** but **auto-close for activity selections** and when user clicks outside the navigation area.
- Diagnostic logging added: `MELODY_NAME_DEBUG` in `generateSoundHighOrLowMelody()` to trace melody selection; further duration logging planned.
- UI melody name now cleared before generation and updated post-generation to prevent stale titles.
- Identified cause of hamburger menu auto-close: inline `window.innerWidth < 1024 ? menuOpen = false : null` present in chapter/activity button handlers in `src/index.html`; remove or adjust this condition.
- Auto-close conditions removed via sed from `src/index.html`; verify menu remains open across breakpoints.
- Auto-close `@click.away` directive reinstated for menu content div to close on outside clicks; remaining menu should stay open on mobile.
- Refined hamburger menu: activity buttons now auto-close the menu; chapters remain open; click-away closes menu on mobile.
- `reset_1_1_HighOrLow_Progress` now dispatches a `high-or-low-reset` event via `$nextTick` to force UI refresh (progress display & background) after reset.
- However, user reports progress still persists after reload; reset logic not fully effective – requires deeper investigation (localStorage & component state).
- `resetCurrentActivity` now auto-detects the current mode when called without a parameter, ensuring the correct per-activity reset function is invoked.
- New 1_2 requirements: ensure wave mode starts with a wave sample (and frog mode with a frog sample), fix frog icon rendering issue on Android (uses `/images/1x1.gif`, not UTF-8), and make sure the 1_2 reset button also refreshes background & progress.
- Analysis: random pattern selection causes wrong first sample; need logic to force next pattern to match selected mode/unlocked pattern.
- Implemented fix: forced first-sample logic via sed; unlock now sets `correctAnswer` to newly unlocked pattern ensuring it plays next.
- Removed immediate melody playback; now only the next melody is forced to use the newly unlocked pattern, fixing previous duplicate/non-wave issue.
- Issue: current fix only sets `correctAnswer`; melody generator still randomly picks pattern. Need mechanism (e.g., `nextForcedPattern`) so next melody generation honors the newly unlocked wave/jump pattern.
- Implemented forced pattern mechanism: melody generator now prioritises `correctAnswer` (via `PATTERN_FORCE_DEBUG`) before random selection; requires verification that only one forced wave/jump melody plays.
- Replaced UTF-8 emojis (🐸, 🌊, 🎉) in progress texts with textual tokens (:frog:, :wave:, :celebration:) to improve Android compatibility.
- Added explicit UI refresh in `reset_1_2_MatchSounds_Progress` (dispatches `match-sounds-reset` event) to ensure background & progress update.
- Consider removing the `currentMode` parameter from `resetCurrentActivity` once auto-detection proves reliable.
- Do not add failsafes; focus on diagnostics and unique logging tags if needed.
- Follow global rules: no `chmod +x`, use `bash file.sh`; comments in English; new strings only in `default strings.xml`; accessibility strings end with `_a11y`; when editing `pitches.js` use bash/sed commands instead of direct edits; avoid copying large code blocks—extract reusable functions instead.
- User prefers AI responses to start with rotating prefixes: "!Gut", "OK!", "AHA!", "Siehe da!" (replacing previous "Fertig!/Perfekt!" preference).
- Mascot visibility still failing: Alpine.js reactivity problem – overlay remains `display:none` after `showMascot` toggles.
- Temporary DOM-fallback forces display but bypasses delay; a structural fix is required (move overlay outside `pitches()` scope or use `Alpine.store`).
- Once structural fix works, DOM fallback must be removed and 2 s delay reinstated.
- New requirement: When entering an activity via navigation, all mascot timers must be cleared and the message hidden immediately.
