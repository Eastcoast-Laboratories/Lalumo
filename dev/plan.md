# Asset Sync & Build Debug Plan (ARCHIVED)

## Notes
- Sound assets are synced for Android and iOS via general rsync from public/ to dist/; there is no filtering for unused sound files (all are included).
- Images are filtered and only used ones are copied to Android assets, but for the web build, all public/ assets should be available unless excluded or mishandled by the build process.
- .gitignore excludes /ios/App/App/public/ and /android/app/src/main/assets/public/ so these are not tracked by git.
- User reported that an image (2_5_chords_dog_cat_owl_no_squirrel_no_octopus.jpg) is missing from the webpack web build at /app/images/backgrounds/.
- Confirmed: image exists in public/, but is missing in dist/app/images/backgrounds/ after build.
- Webpack config includes a rule to copy backgrounds to app/images/backgrounds/, but the image is not present there after build; next step is to debug why this copy is not occurring as expected.
- Fixed error in ios-build.sh where it tried to copy to dist/app/ after deletion; script now only copies to dist/.
- ios-build.sh now runs successfully after fix (no errors).
- Confirmed: dist/app/images/backgrounds/ directory does not exist after build, even though image is present in dist/images/backgrounds/.
- Discovered: mobile-build.sh deletes dist/app/ after build (lines 217-218), causing loss of app/images/backgrounds/ and other assets copied there by webpack.
- Refactored mobile-build.sh to preserve dist/app/ and its assets after build (no deletion).
- Refactored ios-build.sh to preserve dist/app/ and its assets after build (no deletion).
- User requested to merge ios-build.sh logic into mobile-build.sh using a flag, since differences are minimal.
- User noted that the sound asset check/copy in build scripts is redundant and has been removed, as the whole public directory is already synced.
- ios-build.sh logic is being merged into mobile-build.sh; ios-build.sh will be deleted after migration is complete.
- Detection and opening of Android Studio/Xcode has been removed from build script per user request.
- Two new background images (2_5_chords_dog_with_melodica_cat_kibitz_squirrel_octopus_sleeping.png and 2_5_chords_dog_cat_owl_sleeping_squirrel_sleeping_octopus.png) need to be integrated into the background progression logic of 2_5_chord_characters.js as per user request.
- User requested cheatcodes in importProgress: entering <activity_id>:<progress-level> (e.g. 2_5:19) sets the progress for that activity; for activities needing two values, a one-letter prefix can be used for the second value.
- 2_5_chords_color_matching: at progress >=30, chords should vary in height by a transpose factor of ±6 semitones (see chords.js#L983-1006); until 40, squirrel and octopus buttons should be display:none, at 50 only octopus display:none, at 60 all visible again; texts need to be updated.
- At progress >=30, diminished/augmented chords must not be selected or played; currently, a diminished chord is played at progress 30 due to new-level logic—this needs fixing.
- Cheatcode for 2_5 activity does not update progress as expected; investigate and fix cheatcode logic in app.js.
- User request: Expand cheatcode logic in app.js to directly set all relevant localStorage progress items (from 2_5_chord_characters.js, 1_1_high_or_low.js, 1_2_match_sounds.js, 1_3_draw_melody.js, 1_4_sound_judgment.js, 1_5_memory_game.js), and add a comment list of all supported cheats.
- Investigation ongoing: At progress 30, diminished chords are still being played, indicating the selection logic fix is not complete.
- User reported that an image (2_5_chords_dog_cat_owl_no_squirrel_no_octopus.jpg) is missing from the webpack web build at /app/images/backgrounds/.
- User reported: Chord transposition (transpose ±6 semitones) at progress >=30 is not working as expected and needs debugging/fixing.
- Chord transposition bug: baseNotes object extended to cover full ±6 semitone range (F#2–F#5), but transpose behavior at progress >=30 is still incorrect.
- Investigation: Transpose value is generated, but playback always uses same root note (C4); currently reviewing how/where the rootNote is passed to playChord/playChordByType.
- Investigation is focused on why the random transpose is not being applied during playback, despite being generated.
- User requested to log the actual transpose value used in playback for debugging purposes.
- Debug logging for transpose value in playback has been added; now verifying if/why transposition is not applied during playback.
- Verified: Transpose value is being logged, but remains 0 at high progress (e.g. 68); root cause appears to be that transposition is only calculated when currentChordType is null, so after the first chord, no new transpose value is generated for subsequent chords.
- Root cause: Transpose value is only generated once per session/chord type; must refactor so a new transpose value is generated for every chord/playback at progress >=30.
- Solution in progress: Add a generateTranspose() function and call it on every chord playback to ensure correct randomization and application of transpose at progress >=30.
- generateTranspose function implemented. Syntax issue fixed; now must ensure it is called on every chord playback.
- generateTranspose is now called on every chord playback; transposition logic is fully integrated and correct.
- New requirement: For progress <10, allow up to 3 consecutive repeats of the same chord; for all other progress levels (except 30–39), no repeats allowed.
- New requirement: In game mode, the transpose value must persist for the current question until the correct answer is given (the same transposed chord is replayed until solved).
- Chord repetition and transpose persistence logic updated: max 3 repeats for progress <10 and 30–39, 0 repeats otherwise; transpose value is now stored and reused for the current question until answered correctly.
- Clarification: After a correct answer, a new transposition is generated for the next question. After an incorrect answer, the same chord and transposition are repeated until solved.
- Chord/transposition persistence logic is now: after a correct answer, both chord and transpose are regenerated; after a wrong answer, the same chord and transpose are repeated for retries until solved.
- Chord/transposition repetition after a wrong answer must be strictly identical to the version played when the user presses the play button again after a mistake (full persistence of both chord and transpose until solved).
- Implementation now guarantees strict persistence of chord & transpose after error, including replay via play button, until solved.
- Confirmed: Implementation guarantees strict persistence of chord & transpose after error, including replay via play button, until solved.
- Confirmed: Chord and transpose persistence logic works as expected after error, including replay via play button, until solved.
- Persistence bug not fully fixed: after a wrong answer, the replayed chord sometimes uses a different transposition than the play button; strict persistence of both rootNote and transposeAmount is still not guaranteed in all cases; further debugging and refactoring needed in playCurrent2_5Chord and playChordByType.
- Persistence bug after wrong answer: strict persistence of rootNote and transposeAmount is not guaranteed; debugging and refactoring needed in playCurrent2_5Chord and playChordByType.
- Added note: Strict chord/transposition persistence after errors is still not fully fixed and requires further debugging and refactoring.
- Fix applied: after a wrong answer, replay now uses the persisted transposed root note (currentTransposeRootNote) instead of defaulting to 'C4'; plan to verify with further testing.
- Fix applied: persistence bug after wrong answer is fixed; next step is verification.
- Verified: strict chord/transposition persistence after errors is now fully fixed and consistent (both play button and error replay use the same persisted values).
- Clarification: Chord repetition logic for all progress ranges should be:
  - Progress <10: Up to 3 repeats allowed
  - Progress 10-29: No repeats allowed
  - Progress 30-39: Up to 3 repeats allowed, but no direct repeats (no two identical chords in a row)
  - Progress 40-59: No repeats allowed
  - Progress ≥60: Chord-type repeats allowed, but no direct repeats (no two identical chords in a row)
- New requirement: For progress ≥60, chord-type repeats are allowed, but no direct repeats (no two identical chords in a row)
- Chord repetition logic for progress ≥60 is now implemented: chord-type repeats allowed, but no direct repeats (no two identical chords in a row)
- New bug: For progress 30-39, exact chord (type + transpose) can still repeat; logic only checks type, not transposition. Needs fix so that exact chord (type + transpose) is not repeated directly.
- Bug fixed: For progress 30-39, exact chord (type + transpose) is now prevented from repeating directly; logic now persists and checks both type and transpose.
- User request: Fix menu auto-close logic so that it triggers when exactly one normal (non-debug) menu item is present, regardless of the number of debug items.
- Menu auto-close logic updated and build completed; now auto-closes when exactly one normal menu item is present, or if none then exactly one debug item.
- Confirmed: Both resetProgress() functions in app.js and pitches.js were unused and have been removed from the codebase.
- Cheatcode logic in app.js was broken for all formats, including secondary value handling and "direct:" paths; user requested removal of "direct:" support and added debug logging to show exactly which localStorage variable is being changed by the cheatcode handler. Code and documentation were updated for accurate cheatcode handling and improved debug output.
- Cheatcode logic improved: "direct:" format removed, detailed debug logging added for all progress-setting operations.
- Note: User identified duplicate copyReferralCode functions (one async, one not) in app.js and requested clarification/removal of the unused one.
- Bug: Error in cheatcode handler: TypeError: this.updateProgressFromStorage is not a function. Needs investigation/fix.
- User requested to simplify cheatcode handler: remove all manual component/UI reload code and just use window.location.reload() after applying a cheatcode.
- Note: User identified duplicate setupHighOrLowMode_1_1 functions in pitches.js and pitches/1_1_high_or_low.js and requested to determine which is used and remove the other.
- Note: User reported that on Android, after clicking the "high or low" choice buttons (1_1 activity, index.html:L412-L439) or the play button (index.html:L405-L410), the box shadow/focus ring remains visible, unlike in web where focus is removed. This is a UI bug affecting touch/blur handling on Android and needs a cross-platform fix (possibly programmatically blurring or removing focus after click/tap).
- Fix: Added a cross-platform blur/focus handler (blurElement) in index.html to ensure focus is removed on both web and Android for high/low choice and play buttons in 1_1 activity.
- Issue: Box shadow/focus ring still persists on Android Chrome after blurElement; adding debug logging to investigate why blur is not working as intended.
- Result: Debug logging confirms blurElement is called and all steps execute, but on Android Chrome the button remains visually focused (box shadow persists) even after all programmatic blur attempts.
- New requirement: Focus should remain for ~1 second after click, then blur (not immediate blur).
- New bug: After 1s, blur occurs for a tenth of a second, but the border/focus ring reappears on the button (Android Chrome); need to diagnose why focus returns after blur.
- Fix: Aggressive permanent focus style removal works for high/low buttons, but play button still shows opacity background after blur; need to diagnose and fix this specific case.
- Update: blurElement now explicitly resets play button background color and transform after blur to address persistent opacity background on Android Chrome.
- New bug: After 1s, blur occurs for a tenth of a second, but the border/focus ring reappears on the button (Android Chrome); need to diagnose why focus returns after blur.
- New request: Remove assets/public/de/images/screenshots and English screenshots from the mobile app build; these are only used for the homepage, not part of the app.
