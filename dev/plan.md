# Referrals System Redesign Plan

## Notes
- User wants to keep a single unlock flag: `areAllActivitiesUnlocked`.
- This flag should unlock three specific activities: "Draw a Melody", "Memory Game" (both in Pitches), and "Chord Story Characters" (in Chords).
- The entire Chords chapter should NOT be unlocked, only these activities.
- UI text in referrals.html and menus must reflect new unlock logic.
- Each of the three activities should have a second, always-unlocked debug button with class `debug-element`.
- Only remove the debug-element main Chords button, not the main Chords chapter button itself; menu should auto-open 2_2 if only one subitem is present.
- Refactor Chords activities: ensure correct lock/unlock logic and debug buttons after menu changes.
- Update referral-related UI strings in both English and German resource files.
- Deployment tested; F-Droid badge image still inaccessible due to double homepage/homepage in URL. Need to fix image path in template or webpack config.
- F-Droid badge image path fixed in template; verified accessible locally and in production.
- User requested to update homepage feature description to mention palm rejection for multitouch.
- F-Droid metadata (com.lalumo.app.yml) is now auto-generated by F-Droid; only license and open source compliance needed in the app itself.
- User requested to add license information to AndroidManifest.xml for F-Droid compliance.
- User requested to generate metadata/com.lalumo.app.yml for F-Droid submission with current version info (3.0, versionCode 26).
