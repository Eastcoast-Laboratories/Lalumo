# Username Creation Info Box Plan

## Notes
- User wants an info box to appear after username creation.
- Info box should say: "dein name ist ... . Du kannst dies in den Einstellungen Ã¤ndern"
- This should happen immediately after the username is created.
- Usernames should be editable in the settings.
- The toast notification system is used for the info box.
- The info box correctly displays the username via string replacement.
- The toast auto-dismisses after 5 seconds; no manual close needed.
- User requested: For local dev, referral URLs must be http://localhost:8080/referral.php (not /api/referral.php)
- Username info box and update messages are now localized in both English and German
- Update fallback message in setUsername to English unless localized in German
- Add 1s delay before memory game feedback sound
- Localize unlock_squirrel_message, unlock_octopus_message, and all_animals_unlocked in EN/DE
