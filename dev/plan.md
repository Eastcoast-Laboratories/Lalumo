# Musici File Structure Alignment Plan

## Notes
- User identified /src/effects/feedback.js as being in the wrong place.
- Reference canonical structure in dev/FILESTRUCTURE.md, shared utilities should live under `src/components/shared/`.
- The directory `src/components/shared/` has been created to house shared utilities.
- `feedback.js` relocated to `src/components/shared/`.
- Manual review revealed and fixed one import referencing the old path.
- Must also look for any other JS files that violate the documented structure and relocate them.
- After relocating, all import paths across the codebase must be updated.
- Update dev/FILESTRUCTURE.md to match the new, real structure.
- Adhere to user global rules: no fallback code, no unnecessary deployment, add diagnostics if needed.
- Git checkout/reset commands are disallowed; repair files manually.
- User confirmed file structure is correct; focus shifts to enhancing Chord Chapter user experience.
- User requested to review Chord code first and keep 2_x abbreviations in function names.
- Main Chords entry file is `src/components/chords.js`; sub-modules `2_*` will be migrated later.
- Rainbow feedback integrated into `chords.js` across all chord activities.
- Runtime error `checkColorAnswer is not defined` observed in `chords.js`; must fix.
- `checkColorAnswer` now imported into chords.js, error resolved.
- Tone.js audio and richer landscapes integrated into 2_2 mood landscapes.
- Play-full-chord button implemented in 2_3 chord-building.
- Audio-engine singleton (`src/components/audio-engine.js`) now powers all chord sounds; initAudio simply ensures `audioEngine.initialize()` is called upon first user gesture.
- User reports no sound in 2_1 and 2_2, and missing/unresponsive Play Full Chord button in 2_3; suspect off-screen buttonsâ€”set containers to 100% viewport height and debug Tone.js initialization / Transport start.
- Initial fixes committed: forced Tone.start() in initAudio, added full-height CSS for activity containers, and improved Play Full Chord button container lookup; awaiting user verification.
- `setupFullHeightContainers` function has been implemented to enforce 100vh containers and style rules.
- Replaced require usage in setupFullHeightContainers to avoid bundler issues; enhanced Tone.js auto-start logic and fixed Play Full Chord button positioning.
- User requested moving injected CSS rules into external stylesheet `src/styles/2_chords.css` and setting `.chord-chapters-view` height to 800px.
- Created external stylesheet `src/styles/2_chords.css` including chord activity styles and `.chord-chapters-view` height rule.
- Stylesheet now imported in `chords.js`, and inline CSS injection removed from `setupFullHeightContainers`.
- Initial background image for 2_5 chord characters added in index.html activity container.
- `updateCharacterBackground` function implemented and wired into `chords.js` (init & after correct answer); progress now persisted in `lalumo_chords_progress` (localStorage).
- User requested extracting `update_progress_display` helper from pitches.js into a shared `common.js` for reuse.
- `updateCharacterBackground` function implemented and wired into `chords.js` (init & after correct answer); progress now persisted in `lalumo_chords_progress` (localStorage).
- User requested extracting `update_progress_display` helper from pitches.js into a shared `common.js` for reuse.
- Discovery: two separate common.js files already exist (`src/components/pitches/common.js` and `src/components/2_chords/common.js`); need unified location for shared UI helpers.
- New shared helper module `src/components/shared/ui-helpers.js` created containing `update_progress_display`; imported into `pitches.js`.
- Shared UI helper now also imported in `chords.js` and used in 2_5 character activity to update progress display.
- Runtime bug: `$store is not defined` when `update_progress_display` executes inside `chords.js` (Alpine context missing). Must refactor call to avoid direct `$store` reference (use component or Alpine.store()).
- Need to remove legacy `update_progress_display` method from `pitches.js` and redirect all calls to shared helper.
- Runtime bug `$store is not defined` in 2_5 progress display has been fixed by constructing strings via `this.$store` before passing to helper.
- New UI issue: progress display shows duplicate "Correct answers" lines and no unlock hint. Must ensure single element and dynamic hint ("Get 10 correct ...", "Get 20 correct ...") renders correctly.
- Removed redundant JS progress display in 2_5; Alpine bindings now show correct count and unlock hints.
- `debug-element` CSS class added to `main.css` to hide debug buttons by default; visibility toggled via `body.dev-mode`.
- Inline `style="opacity: 0;"` attributes auto-replaced with `class="debug-element"` in index.html via sed.
- Frontend protection added: users cannot redeem their own referral code (redeemFriendCode now checks against `referralCode`).
- Backend PHP now blocks self-redeem attempts when the username is supplied; frontend must include `username` in the redeem request.
- Duplicate `redeemFriendCode` functions detected in `src/components/app.js` (lines ~291 and ~1953); older version must be removed to prevent conflicting logic.
- Duplicate `redeemFriendCode` functions issue resolved: older version replaced with stub comment; only enhanced version remains.
- Referral section being extracted to partial `src/partials/referrals.html`; `html-loader` dev dependency installed to enable inclusion via webpack.
- Need to update `webpack.config.js` with `html-loader` rule and adjust `index.html` to load partial.

- Introduced `utils/html-include.js` and `loadHtmlPartials()` runs post-Alpine to inject referral partial at runtime.
- Runtime in browser shows `HTML partial loading error` (fetch 404 for ./partials/referrals.html); need to adjust dev server path or include utility logic.
- Path handling updated in html-include.js and index.html to use absolute `/src/partials/referrals.html`; awaiting verification.
- [x] Call `loadHtmlPartials()` after Alpine initialization to render partials

- Existing file `src/components/pitches/1_2_match_sounds.js` already contains some helper logic.
- New directory `src/components/1_pitches/` created to hold pitch activity modules; need to consolidate location.
- New directory `src/components/1_pitches/` was created by mistake; per FILESTRUCTURE.md, activity modules stay under `src/components/pitches/`. Must consolidate to a single canonical path and remove duplicates.
- New directory `src/components/1_pitches/` was created by mistake; per FILESTRUCTURE.md, activity modules must remain in `src/components/pitches/`. Consolidation required.
- Duplicate directory `src/components/1_pitches/` has been removed.

- [ ] Once build passes, test 1_2_match_sounds activity end-to-end
- Runtime Alpine error: `component.stopCurrentSound is not a function` discovered in 1_2 activity; calling undefined method.
- Earlier attempt to inline call caused massive syntax errors; must revert and instead export `stopCurrentSound` from pitches.js and import in 1_2 module.
- Approach: add named export `stopCurrentSound` in pitches.js (no structural rewrite), alias in component (`this.stopCurrentSound` already exists), and import `{ stopCurrentSound }` into 1_2_match_sounds.js; call directly.
- [ ] Fix `stopCurrentSound` undefined runtime error (expose/export function and import in 1_2 module)
  - [ ] Revert erroneous inline replacement in pitches.js
  - [ ] Add `export function stopCurrentSound(component)` helper encapsulating existing logic

  - [ ] Run build & verify 1_2 activity functionality
  - [ ] Retest 1_2_match_sounds activity end-to-end after fix

{{ ... }}
- **Observation:** logs indicate `fetchReferralCount` may never be invoked on startup; need to ensure it runs after loading referral data and on interval.

## Current Goal
Verify deep link parsing & click-count UI
- URL hash parsing implemented in app.js (parseUrlHash in init) to handle #ref and #activity deep links.
- [x] Detect `#ref=<CODE>` on load and pre-fill referral flow
- [x] Detect `#activity=<ID>` and auto-start corresponding activity
- [ ] Add unit/e2e tests for hash parsing

- Deep link implementation caused runtime error: `showChordActivity is not a function`; need to add or import this method.
- Coding standard reminder: comments must always be written in English.
- [ ] Fix `showChordActivity is not a function` runtime error
## Current Goal
Fix showChordActivity runtime error & verify deep links
- Deep link implementation updated: switched to event dispatching; runtime error fixed.
