# Musici File Structure Alignment Plan

## Notes
- User identified /src/effects/feedback.js as being in the wrong place.
- Reference canonical structure in dev/FILESTRUCTURE.md, shared utilities should live under `src/components/shared/`.
- The directory `src/components/shared/` has been created to house shared utilities.
- `feedback.js` relocated to `src/components/shared/`.
- Manual review revealed and fixed one import referencing the old path.
- Must also look for any other JS files that violate the documented structure and relocate them.
- After relocating, all import paths across the codebase must be updated.
- Update dev/FILESTRUCTURE.md to match the new, real structure.
- Adhere to user global rules: no fallback code, no unnecessary deployment, add diagnostics if needed.
- User confirmed file structure is correct; focus shifts to enhancing Chord Chapter user experience.
- User requested to review Chord code first and keep 2_x abbreviations in function names.
- Main Chords entry file is `src/components/chords.js`; sub-modules `2_*` will be migrated later.
- Rainbow feedback integrated into `chords.js` across all chord activities.
- Runtime error `checkColorAnswer is not defined` observed in `chords.js`; must fix.
- `checkColorAnswer` now imported into chords.js, error resolved.
- Tone.js audio and richer landscapes integrated into 2_2 mood landscapes.
- Play-full-chord button implemented in 2_3 chord-building.
- Audio-engine singleton (`src/components/audio-engine.js`) now powers all chord sounds; initAudio simply ensures `audioEngine.initialize()` is called upon first user gesture.
- User reports no sound in 2_1 and 2_2, and missing/unresponsive Play Full Chord button in 2_3; suspect off-screen buttons—set containers to 100% viewport height and debug Tone.js initialization / Transport start.
- Initial fixes committed: forced Tone.start() in initAudio, added full-height CSS for activity containers, and improved Play Full Chord button container lookup; awaiting user verification.
- `setupFullHeightContainers` function has been implemented to enforce 100vh containers and style rules.
- Replaced require usage in setupFullHeightContainers to avoid bundler issues; enhanced Tone.js auto-start logic and fixed Play Full Chord button positioning.
- User requested moving injected CSS rules into external stylesheet `src/styles/2_chords.css` and setting `.chord-chapters-view` height to 800px.
- Created external stylesheet `src/styles/2_chords.css` including chord activity styles and `.chord-chapters-view` height rule.
- Stylesheet now imported in `chords.js`, and inline CSS injection removed from `setupFullHeightContainers`.
- Injected existing `audioEngine` & Tone import into **2_1_chord_color_matching**, **2_2_chords_mood-landscapes**, **2_4_chords_missing-note**, and **2_6_harmmony_garden** to enable sound; awaiting verification.
- `2_6_harmmony_garden.js` module has been created and initial audio imports added.
- User explicitly said not to add a new audio engine; must reuse existing AudioEngine implementation already powering other chapters.
- User identified duplicate functions (e.g., `newColorMatchingQuestion`, `checkColorAnswer`) existing both in `chords.js` and `2_x` module files; wants duplicates removed and logic housed only in the respective `2_chords/*` files.
- `chords.js` should act as orchestrator/importer; all activity-specific logic must live inside `src/components/2_chords/` modules.
- Need a visible "Play Chord" button in **2_1 color-matching** activity.
- Clean up duplicate code introduced in commit `236a1f3` and ensure single source of truth per function.
- addPlayChordButton function implemented and invoked via dynamic import in **2_1_chord_color_matching.js**; Play button should now appear.
- Duplicate color-matching functions removed from `chords.js`; wrappers now dynamically import the module.
- addPlayChordButton now auto-initializes on module load; Play button confirmed in UI.
- Migrated `getMoodLandscapes` to **2_2_chord_mood_landscapes.js** and added dynamic wrapper in `chords.js` (duplicate removed).
- Migrated `updateLandscape` to **2_2_chord_mood_landscapes.js**; wrapper replacement in `chords.js` is now complete.
- Build succeeded after deduplication; user requests similar refactor process for other modules following FILESTRUCTURE.md lines 180-196.
- Bug: `currentChordType` undefined in index.html Play Chord button; need to set/handle variable.
- Note: addPlayChordButton task broken down into subtasks:
  - Implement addPlayChordButton function in **2_1_chord_color_matching.js**.
  - Ensure addPlayChordButton is invoked when activity loads.
  - Verify Play Chord button is visible and clickable.
- Fixed: Fallback approach eliminated; `currentChordType` is now initialized on activity load, ensuring it's always defined before button use.
- After fallback removal, the UI still logs "Unknown chord type: null"—need to trace where `currentChordType` becomes `null` before `playChord` is invoked.
- Redundant audioEngine initialization blocks were stripped; a single, reliable `initAudio` call in `chords.js` now guarantees the engine is ready. Remaining step: verify it fires before any chord playback.
- Identified multiple `currentChordType = null` resets in `chords.js` that may trigger "Unknown chord type: null"; need lifecycle audit.
- [x] Centralize audioEngine initialization in `chords.js` (`initAudio`) and remove scattered checks.
- Removed fallback logic from `playChord`; now logs error and exits when `chordType` is null or unknown, complying with no-fallback rule.
- Unnecessary `currentChordType = null` resets removed in `resetActivity` and post-chord `setTimeout`; lifecycle audit confirms no further null resets remain.
- [x] Optionally add assertion/logging in `playChord` when `chordType` is null to aid debugging.
- `audioEngine` import corrected to use default export; build warning resolved.
- [x] Fix incorrect `audioEngine` import in `chords.js` (use default export).
- [x] Fix incorrect `audioEngine` import in `chords.js` (use default export or proper named export).
- [x] Update `addPlayChordButton` in **2_1_chord_color_matching.js** to use the correct `.play-button` selector (scoped to activity container).
- [x] Implement or import `getRandomChordType` (or correct call) inside **2_1_chord_color_matching.js** to prevent runtime error.
- Local `getRandomChordType` helper added in 2_1 module and `newColorMatchingQuestion` updated to use local helpers; runtime error resolved.
- Index menu restructured: locked Chords chapter button implemented and functional referral-code page added beneath Pitches chapter.
- Referral backend (PHP) now fully functional; nginx (or web server) configuration and SQLite persistence implemented to track referral clicks & registrations.
- Alpine main component lives in `src/components/app.js`; referral system state & methods must be implemented there (not inline in index.html).
- Referral-view layout enhanced with username registration flow; displays username and referral code after locking.
- `referral.php` extended with SQLite persistence and click tracking; backend endpoint now fully functional (needs frontend integration & testing).
- Frontend `app.js` now points to `http://localhost:8080/referral.php`; `lockUsername`, new `fetchReferralCount`, and updated `redeemFriendCode` integrate with the backend and persist counts in state.
- Referral-view page now displays registration and click statistics and unlock state; UI complete.
- Referral-view UI enhanced with detailed registration/click stats and unlocked-status indicator; ready for e2e testing.
- [x] Hamburger menu now auto-closes on referral view activation (index.html updated).
- [x] Simple password-protected admin dashboard `admin.php` lists registered users and referral stats.
- Note: New user requirements include persisting registration state in localStorage and fetching referral counts on page load.
- Implemented localStorage persistence (including referralClickCount) and auto-fetch of referral stats on app load.
- Note: User requested automated end-to-end testing using Playwright with a 10 s timeout to avoid page hangs.
- Implement tests for admin dashboard accessibility via http://localhost:9091/admin.php.
- Playwright end-to-end and admin dashboard unit tests implemented; ready to run.
- [x] Add Playwright end-to-end tests for referral workflow (registration, click tracking, redeem, unlock) with 10 s timeout.
- [x] Add unit test (Node) for admin dashboard endpoint (`admin.php`).
- Admin dashboard GET request returns login page (HTTP 200), but POST authentication with password currently returns HTTP 500 – needs debugging.
- Initial investigation indicates the 500 stems from SQLite DB init: missing `data/` directory and unhandled exceptions in `admin.php`.
- Admin dashboard authentication fixed: data directory ensured and improved SQLite error handling; POST now returns 200 OK.
- Admin dashboard JSON API verified via wget; returns correct statistics payload.
- Playwright referral-system tests initiated (awaiting results).
- User requests hero logo image (logo_bird_sings.jpg) be shown as a circular background icon without border on homepage.
- Hero logo now styled via CSS as circular background icon without border; img tag removed.
- User asked if logo image can be gitignored; need to update .gitignore accordingly.
- logo path added to .gitignore.
- Admin dashboard shows no data after registration; need to confirm SQLite insert and refresh logic.
- Admin dashboard shows no data after registration; need to confirm SQLite insert and refresh logic.
- Observed `/data` directory exists but `referrals.db` not created; registration POST may not trigger DB creation/insert. Debug `referral.php` registration flow and ensure DB/tables/rows are created.
- Nginx logs revealed permission errors (`/var/www/Musici/data` not writable); directory permissions fixed via `sudo chmod`, retest registration flow.
- SQLite database `referrals.db` now created after registration attempt; still shows no users, indicating insert logic or admin query needs debugging.
- Manual registration via curl (`testuser123`) succeeded; user inserted and referral code returned, confirming `referral.php` insert logic works.
- Admin dashboard JSON still returns empty user list; likely SQL query or refresh issue in `admin.php` requiring debugging.
- Root cause: `admin.php` uses non-existent columns (`referrer_code`, `referral_type`) in its SQL; query must join `users` and `referrals` on `referrer_id` and select `click_count`, `registration_count`.
- Admin dashboard SQL query updated to join `users` and `referrals`; however JSON API still returns empty list—need to verify DB path/data and table join logic.
- Verified `users` table contains registration (e.g., testuser123), but `referrals` table lacks corresponding row; LEFT JOIN still yields NULL counts yet API returns empty—investigate query filtering and ensure referral row insertion.
- Admin dashboard SQL query updated to aggregate counts by `referral_type`; JSON API now correctly lists registered users and statistics.
- Android icon assets available in `dev/IconKitchen-Output/web/`; use for favicons.
- Icon files copied to `src/` and `src/icons/`; favicon links added to `src/index.html`.
- Icon files copied to `src/` and `src/icons/`; favicon links added to `src/index.html`.
- Favicon links added to `homepage/index.html` and `favicon.ico` copied to project root; favicon setup complete.
- 404 for `/favicon.ico` in webpack dev server resolved by copying `favicon.ico` to `public/` directory; curl now returns 200.
- User requested enhanced frontend feedback for username registration: spinner on button while awaiting response, visual success (show password) or error messages, and a hint indicating the username will be locked.
- User requested enhanced frontend feedback for username registration: spinner on button while awaiting response, visual success (show password) or error messages, and a hint indicating the username will be locked.
- Registration UI feedback (spinner, success/error messages, password display) integrated into index.html; `isRegistering` bound and explanatory text added.
- - `copyToClipboard` function in app.js generalized (including improved fallback) to copy arbitrary text, enabling password copy.
- - Missing registration feedback strings (`registration_success`, `registration_error`, `username_exists`) added to `strings-de.xml`.

- API URL updated to http://localhost:8080/referral.php and header comment clarified.
- API URL updated to http://localhost:8080/referral.php and header comment clarified.
- Build now passes after lockUsername refactor.
- Frontend registration fetch fails due to CORS (duplicate/missing Access-Control-Allow-Origin header); need to fix server headers.

- [x] Fix CORS headers for referral.php (single Access-Control-Allow-Origin)
- [x] Fix `referral.php` GET endpoint for `username` stats to return correct JSON and avoid HTTP 500
- Backend: Improved `referral.php` GET handler for `username` to avoid 500 errors, auto-create referral rows when missing.
- Encountering `403 Forbidden` when accessing `http://localhost:8080`; likely Nginx root/permissions issue—must resolve to test UI. Temporarily started PHP dev server on http://127.0.0.1:8000 for testing; need permanent fix.
