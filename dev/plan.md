# Musici Referrals & Translation Plan

## Notes
- The checkmark (âœ“) in referrals.html is now green (CSS change completed).
- All referral-related strings have been translated to German and added to strings.xml (values-de).
- Specific string keys translated: "your_referral_code", "referred_by", and "referral_info".
- Extract all user-facing strings from referrals.html (lines 1-92) and add them to strings.xml (both English and German).
- Do not add fallbacks or failsafes; fix problems directly.
- Only update default strings.xml for new strings, not other variants.
- Next: Systematically scan all JavaScript files for user-facing strings not yet present in the translation system (strings.xml). List these untranslated strings for further localization.
- Initial scan found alert/confirm messages in JS not using $store.strings. Continue and complete the systematic listing.
- Systematic search for alert, confirm, and showToast messages in JS completed. Relevant untranslated strings have been listed for localization.
- Dynamically composed and multi-line user-facing strings (e.g., constructed with += or template literals) were previously overlooked; these must also be extracted for translation.
- Translation prompt markdown file created and refined. User clarified: do not translate /dev/ files, shell scripts, comments, unreachable code, or log entries.
- Translation prompt updated: Only fallback pattern `this.$store.strings?.key_name || 'Fallback'` is allowed; code-fallback texts are explicitly excluded from translation. Examples and instructions in translation_prompt.md are now more precise.
- translation_prompt.md reviewed and updated: examples improved, concrete next steps for systematic JS string migration and verification documented.
- Alert and toast messages from translation prompt have been added to both EN/DE XML files; ready for code refactor.
- Systematic JS code refactor and verification per translation_prompt.md is ongoing.
- Systematic JS string migration and verification is ongoing.
- Alert/toast message migration in app.js is underway, with more to follow.
- This pattern is now documented in the translation prompt; migration to strings.xml is planned for consistency.
- All isGerman-based strings from pitches/common.js have been added to English and German XML files; ready for code refactor.
- User clarified: the "no matching activity" fallback in resetCurrentActivity does not need to be translated or migrated, as it is unreachable by design.
- All isGerman-based UI strings from pitches.js have been added to English and German XML files; ready for code refactor.
- Dynamic error and import messages are now being migrated to $store.strings in app.js; process is ongoing.
- Copy error messages have been migrated to $store.strings in app.js.
- Invalid save code error messages have been migrated to $store.strings in app.js.
- No data to copy error messages have been migrated to $store.strings in app.js.
- Progress reset success messages have been migrated to $store.strings in app.js.
- New: Website must be generated from a single HTML template source for both English (/) and German (/de/), using adjacent <span lang="en"> and <span lang="de"> blocks. At build, filter for the target language. All assets/links must use absolute paths. Navigation and SEO (hreflang, canonical) must be correct. Webpack/html-loader/language-loader setup required. Integrate this into the existing main webpack config for both app and homepage, as per latest user feedback and inspection, to ensure seamless integration and avoid separate config duplication. The multilingual static website build system must be integrated into the existing main webpack config (not a separate config), per latest user feedback and inspection.
- New: All language-specific HTML outputs (e.g. index.html, agb.html, etc.) must be generated from a single source-template file (e.g. index-template.html, agb-template.html, etc.) containing both languages, following the same adjacent lang="en"/"de" markup convention. This means that each HTML output will have a corresponding source-template file that includes both English and German content, marked with lang="en" and lang="de" respectively, allowing for easy maintenance and updates.
- Update: index-template.html is being refactored to use adjacent lang="en"/"de" blocks for all relevant meta tags, Open Graph tags, favicon, and SEO alternate/canonical links, as the standard for all language-specific HTML outputs.
- Progress: Hero section and download buttons in index-template.html are now being refactored to use adjacent lang="en"/"de" blocks for multilingual content, continuing the systematic template update.
- Update: Features section and GitHub link in index-template.html are now being refactored to use adjacent lang="en"/"de" blocks for multilingual content, continuing the systematic template update.
- Progress: Feature cards in the features section of index-template.html are now being refactored to use adjacent lang="en"/"de" blocks for multilingual content, continuing the systematic template update.
- Update: All four feature cards in the features section of index-template.html are now being refactored to use adjacent lang="en"/"de" blocks for multilingual content, continuing the systematic template update.
- Update: Screenshots section in index-template.html is now refactored to use adjacent lang="en"/"de" blocks for multilingual content (headings and all screenshot captions completed), continuing the systematic template update.
- Update: Footer section in index-template.html is now fully refactored to use adjacent lang="en"/"de" blocks for multilingual content, including copyright and Web App links. The template refactor for index-template.html is now complete.
- Progress: index-template.html refactor is complete; next focus is integrating the language-loader into the main webpack config for multilingual builds.
- Update: Language-loader is present and confirmed functional; webpack integration for multilingual builds is now in progress.
- Update: Webpack config now generates both English (root) and German (/de/) homepage templates using the language-loader, and asset copying for both language versions is handled. Multilingual build system integration is complete; next, asset/navigation link adjustments and SEO tags, then build verification.
- Progress: Multilingual build system integration is complete; next: test build output and verify / and /de/ output, links, and SEO.
- Update: Asset copying for icons and homepage assets is now handled for both languages, but build errors persist due to unresolved absolute icon paths (e.g., /icons/apple-touch-icon.png). Next: resolve asset path issues in templates or config and re-test build.
- Note: Build still fails due to unresolved absolute icon paths, despite copying assets for both languages. Next step: resolve asset path issues in templates or webpack config and re-test build.
- Update: Icon paths in index-template.html have been changed from absolute to relative paths to resolve build errors. Next: re-run build and verify output.
